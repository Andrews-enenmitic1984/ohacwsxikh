Okay, I just walked out of seeing Heart Eyes, and man, my brain's doing that thing where it's trying to process way too much at once, kind of like when your phone’s frozen but you're still desperately tapping the screen. Am I making sense? Probably not, but neither did half of this movie, and I'm weirdly okay with it.

The whole experience felt like one of those sneaky roller coasters that look kinda dull at first, but then reveal a hidden twist that flips your stomach upside down. Seriously, the plot twisted more than a contortionist at a circus, and yet here I am, still piecing it together. It’s like, watching the characters slog through their universally bad decisions felt both incredibly relatable and like a flawless next-level strategy in making audiences collectively shout WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?!.

> The lead was something else, though. Half the time I couldn't tell if they were incredible or if I’d just eaten too much popcorn and was delirious. Their eyes spoke a billion words that the dialogue didn’t even come close to capturing. I was caught somewhere between wanting to download the movie later to unpack their expressions and considering this is why downloading weird dreams would be a terrible idea.

Irony doesn't even begin to capture some of the scenes. Like, let’s have a dramatic heart-to-heart in the middle of a downpour, because Hollywood has convinced us that’s the prime confession-weather. I'm torn, because the part of me that's constantly eye-rolling at clichés secretly loves them too. Also, can we talk about how everyone kept saying You just don’t get it? Like, geez, yeah, neither did half the theater, congrats on your groundbreaking dialogue!

Here's where I’d insert something like | while(true) { printf(Heart Eyes
); } //infinite love loop??? but considering my lack of coding skills, it's probably just computer Latin to most.

And the visuals — wow. They didn't just set the mood; they texted, called, and sent a carrier pigeon to drag you into this immersive, sometimes overbearing world. It's like a watercolor painting got bored and decided to throw a wild party on the canvas.

In the end, I’m a mess of awe and confusion, as if the movie handed me a gorgeous puzzle with two pieces conspicuously missing. I’ll maybe watch the movie again in the hopes of finding them, or maybe, just maybe, those missing pieces are why it all somehow worked.
